# Random Snippets of Go Code

I started this repository back when Go was first released. Then I didn't
put anything else up here for 6 years. Well, tonight I added something,
so I had to update this file as well. I may eventually have time to
(a) post more and (b) clean up the ancient examples a bit. We'll see!

## Recent Snippets

- blah/ A silly net/http server that sometimes helps me
debug things.
- confrac/ A concurrent remix of the fractal program from
*Donovan & Kernighan: The Go Programming Language*.

## Ancient Snippets

- rmhttpd/ Two clones of my friend Raluca's twitter-sized web server.
Not really twitter-sized in Go though.
- freq/ Various clones of freq.c from *Kernighan & Pike: The Practice
of Programming*.
